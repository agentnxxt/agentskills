name: skills-frameworks
description: >
  Shared vocabulary of professional skills frameworks used by Autonomyx skills. Contains the
  authoritative mapping of professions to their respective competency frameworks, skill codes,
  level definitions, and cross-framework equivalence tables. Use this skill whenever any
  Autonomyx skill needs to: map a skill to a professional framework, determine proficiency
  levels using a standardized competency model, select the correct framework for a given
  profession, or cross-reference skills across multiple frameworks. Covers IT (SFIA 9),
  cybersecurity (NICE/NIST), data science (EDISON), project management (PMI/IPMA), finance
  (CFA/ACCA), marketing (CIM), HR (SHRM/CIPD), design (UXPA), healthcare (AMIA), legal
  (SRA/ABA), supply chain (ASCM), engineering (UK-SPEC), education (UNESCO ICT), product
  management (Pragmatic), sales, and the European e-Competence Framework as a general fallback.

## Section 1 — Framework Selection Logic

When mapping a person's skills to a framework, follow this order:

1. **Identify the primary profession** from the person's most recent/current job title
2. **Match to the framework table** below
3. If the person spans multiple domains (e.g., a "Data Science Manager" spans EDISON + PMI),
   apply multiple frameworks
4. If no specific framework matches, use the **European e-Competence Framework (e-CF 4.0)**
   as a general fallback for any technology-adjacent role
5. For completely non-technical roles with no applicable framework, use the **Universal
   Proficiency Levels** (Section 12) without a framework code

---

## Section 13 — When No Framework Exists

If the person's industry or profession is not covered by any framework listed above, follow
this protocol:

### Step 1 — Inform the user
Clearly state:
> "I could not find a recognized professional skills framework for **[industry/profession]**.
> The skills in this resume will be evaluated using general proficiency levels (Beginner /
> Intermediate / Advanced / Expert) unless you provide a specific framework."

### Step 2 — Ask the user
> "Do you have a preferred competency framework for **[industry/profession]**?
> This could be:
> - An industry body's competency model (e.g., a professional association's framework)
> - Your company's internal skills matrix or career ladder
> - A government or regulatory competency standard
> - Any other structured skills taxonomy
>
> If you provide a framework (as a URL, document, or description), I will map all skills
> to that framework instead."

### Step 3 — If the user provides a framework
1. Parse the user-provided framework (document, URL, or description)
2. Extract: skill categories, level definitions, competency codes (if any)
3. Map all resume skills to the user-provided framework
4. **Clearly state in the resume:** "Skills evaluated per: [Framework Name] ([source])"

### Step 4 — If the user does not provide a framework
1. Use the Universal Proficiency Levels (Section 12) for all skills
2. **Clearly state in the resume:** "Skills evaluated per: Universal Proficiency Levels
   (no industry-specific framework applied)"

### Mandatory disclosure
Every resume MUST include a **Framework Attribution** line in the Skills section header:

```
**Skills evaluated per:** [Framework Name] ([reference URL or "provided by user" or
"universal proficiency levels"])
```

This ensures transparency — any reader of the resume knows exactly which standard was used
to assess skill levels.

### Recommended Adoption Sequence

1. **Immediate (Month 1–2):**
   - Open-source on GitHub with RFC process and contribution guidelines
   - Publish JSON-LD vocabulary at persistent URI
   - Submit **arXiv preprint** (self-publish, live in 24 hours, no review gate)
   - Submit **IEEE Access paper** (open-access journal, fast peer review ~4–8 weeks)
   - Reach out to SFIA Foundation for partnership discussion
   - **Invite 3–5 academic reviewers** from Tier 7 institutions (start with MIT, IIT Bombay,
     Oxford, IIM Ahmedabad) to review the preprint and provide feedback

2. **Short-term (Month 3–6):**
   - Submit Schema.org extension proposal
   - Engage W3C Credentials Community Group
   - Submit cross-walks to ESCO and O*NET
   - Present at 1–2 industry conferences (EC-TEL, SkillsX)
   - Engage WEF Future of Jobs initiative
   - Submit to **ACM Computing Surveys** (longer review cycle but high-impact)
   - **Form Academic Advisory Board** from Tier 7 institutions (target 10–15 faculty members
     across CS, business, design, healthcare, social sciences)
   - **Engage 5–10 companies** from Tier 8 for industry validation (start with Google,
     Microsoft, Infosys, McKinsey, Deloitte — they have public competency frameworks to
     cross-reference)

3. **Medium-term (Month 6–12):**
   - Submit **CEN Workshop Agreement** proposal (fast-track European norm)
   - Submit **IEEE-SA new standard proposal** (begins the formal standards process —
     this is the multi-year standardization track, distinct from IEEE Access journal
     publication which is already done in Step 1)
   - Engage professional associations (SFIA, PMI, ISACA) for endorsement
   - Partner with 1–2 credentialing platforms (Credly, Open Badges)
   - **Publish joint papers** with academic review board members
   - **Pilot with 2–3 companies** from Tier 8 — validate framework against their
     internal competency models and hiring rubrics

4. **Long-term (Year 1–3):**
   - **IEEE-SA standard ratification** (working group ballots, public comment, revision)
   - **ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 36** standard submission (builds on IEEE-SA and CEN groundwork)
   - Government submissions (EU, US DOL, UK DfE, Singapore, India, Australia)
   - Enterprise HRIS integrations (Workday, SAP)
   - Job board integrations (LinkedIn, Indeed)
   - **Establish permanent Academic + Industry Review Council** with rotating membership
     from Tier 7 and Tier 8 organizations

**Note on IEEE — two distinct tracks:**
- **IEEE Access (journal)** = publish a peer-reviewed paper. Fast (~2 months). Done in Step 1.
- **IEEE-SA (standards body)** = get the framework adopted as a formal IEEE standard (like
  IEEE 802.11 for WiFi). Requires working group formation, drafting, balloting, and public
  comment. Takes 1–3 years. Starts in Step 3, ratified in Step 4.

Both are IEEE, but journal publication is academic visibility while standards adoption is
industry-binding authority.

## Section 15 — Verifier Credibility Hierarchy

Skills can be verified by **anyone** — but the credibility of the verification depends on
**who** verifies it. This section defines the trust hierarchy for skill verification sources.

### The Fundamental Rule: Publicly Verifiable = No Verification Needed

**Publicly verifiable information holds the utmost authority and requires NO third-party
verification.** If anyone can independently confirm a claim by visiting a public URL or
querying a public database, the claim is self-evident.

| Publicly verifiable source | What it proves | Why no verification needed |
|---|---|---|
| **Public GitHub repos** | Code authored, languages used, contribution history | Anyone can view the code, commits, and authorship |
| **Published papers** (Google Scholar, arXiv, IEEE Xplore, PubMed) | Research authored, expertise demonstrated | Papers are publicly indexed with author attribution |
| **Granted patents** (Google Patents, USPTO, EPO) | Inventions, technical innovation | Patent databases are public records |
| **Published npm / PyPI packages** | Open-source authorship, package usage stats | Package registries are public with download counts |
| **Stack Overflow profile** | Community reputation, expertise areas | Reputation scores and answers are publicly visible |
| **Docker Hub images** | Container authorship, pull counts | Public registry with usage stats |
| **Published articles** (Dev.to, Medium, personal blog) | Writing ability, domain knowledge | Articles are publicly accessible |
| **Credly badges (public profile)** | Certification status | Credly profiles are publicly verifiable |
| **Open-source contributions** (merged PRs, issues) | Collaboration, technical skill | Git history is immutable and public |
| **Public speaking** (YouTube, conference sites) | Presentation skills, thought leadership | Videos and speaker listings are public |
| **Published books** (ISBN records) | Authorship, expertise | ISBN databases are public |

**Rule:** When a skill claim is backed by publicly verifiable evidence, mark it in the
resume Proof column as the direct source (e.g., "GitHub: 15 repos") — NOT as "Verified by"
anyone. The public record IS the verification.

### Verifier Credibility Tiers

For skills that are NOT publicly verifiable (e.g., internal project work, team leadership,
soft skills, proprietary domain expertise), the credibility of verification depends on the
verifier. Anyone can verify a skill, but the weight differs:

| Tier | Verifier type | Credibility | Example | Resume label |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **S — Self-Evident** | Public record (no verifier needed) | Absolute | GitHub repo, published paper, granted patent | `GitHub: 15 repos` / `Patent US12345` |
| **A — Institutional** | Accredited university, government body, standards organization | Highest | MIT degree, CFA Institute certification, government license | `Verified by [Institution]` |
| **B — Employer** | Current or former employer (HR department, manager with authority) | Very High | Employment VC from Acme Corp HR, signed reference letter | `Verified by [Company] HR` |
| **C — Industry Certification Body** | Recognized certification authority (not the employer) | High | AWS (Amazon), CNCF, PMI, Cisco, Microsoft | `Certified by [Body]` |
| **D — Assessment Platform** | Independent testing/assessment service | Medium-High | HackerRank, Pluralsight IQ, Codility, StrengthsFinder | `Assessed by [Platform] (Score: X)` |
| **E — Professional Peer** | Named colleague, manager, or client with verifiable identity | Medium | LinkedIn recommendation, signed peer endorsement, VC from named individual | `Endorsed by [Name, Title at Company]` |
| **F — Community** | Aggregated community signal (not a single named individual) | Medium-Low | Stack Overflow reputation, GitHub stars, social proof at scale | `Community: [metric]` |
| **G — Self-Reported** | The individual themselves (no external verification) | Lowest | User's own description of skills and experience | `Self-reported (unverified)` |

### Credibility Combinatorics

Multiple lower-tier verifications can strengthen credibility:
- **E + E + F** (2 peer endorsements + community signal) ≈ **C** (certification-level credibility)
- **D + F** (assessment score + community reputation) ≈ **C**
- **G alone** (self-reported only) = always remains **G** — no number of self-reports increases credibility
- **S** (self-evident) always supersedes all other tiers — it cannot be questioned

### How Credibility Affects the Resume

In the Skills table Proof column, always include the verifier tier:

```
| Python | SFIA:PROG — Level 5 | Expert | [S] GitHub: 15 repos, 2K+ commits; [C] Certified by AWS (Developer Associate) |
| Leadership | — | Advanced | [B] Verified by Acme Corp HR (EmploymentCredential VC); [E] Endorsed by Jane Doe, VP Engineering |
| React | SFIA:PROG — Level 4 | Advanced | [S] GitHub: 8 repos; [F] Stack Overflow: top 5% tag; [D] HackerRank 95/100 |
| Project Management | IPMA:ICB4 — C | Intermediate | [C] Certified by PMI (PMP); [G] Self-reported: led 5 projects |
| Negotiation | — | Intermediate | [G] Self-reported (unverified) |
```

The tier label `[S]`, `[A]`, `[B]`, etc. immediately tells the reader how trustworthy each
proof point is.

## Section 16 — Top Educational Institutions Directory

A reference directory of globally recognized educational institutions organized by discipline.
Used by the `autonomyx-skill-score` skill to:
1. **Assess credential weight** — degrees from top-tier institutions carry stronger signal
2. **Guide verification** — identify which institutions offer digital/verifiable credentials
3. **Enrich the Education section** — add institutional reputation context when relevant

### How to use this directory

When generating a resume:
- If a person's degree is from a listed institution, the Education section MAY note the
  institution's global standing (e.g., "IIT Bombay — India's premier engineering institute")
  only if the user requests it or if the resume targets international audiences who may not
  recognize the institution
- When encouraging credential verification (Step 6), reference whether the institution
  offers digital credentials
- Never rank or compare institutions in the resume itself — simply present the degree factually

### Institution Tier Definitions

| Tier | Criteria |
|---|---|
| **Tier 1 — Global Elite** | Consistently ranked in top 10–20 globally across multiple ranking systems (QS, THE, ARWU, US News). Universally recognized by name. |
| **Tier 2 — World-Class** | Ranked in top 50–100 globally. Widely recognized internationally in their domain. |
| **Tier 3 — Nationally Premier** | Top institution(s) in their country for a specific discipline. May not be globally ranked but carry enormous weight domestically and regionally. |

### Using Institutional Data in Resumes

**Rules:**
1. **Never rank institutions** in the resume — present degrees factually
2. **Add context for international audiences** only when requested:
   - "IIT Bombay (India's premier engineering institute, <1% acceptance rate)"
   - "IIM Ahmedabad (India's top-ranked business school)"
3. **Credential verification guidance**: When encouraging VC verification in Step 6, check
   if the institution offers digital credentials (marked in the tables above) and provide
   specific instructions:
   - "IIT Madras offers digital degree verification via NPTEL — check your alumni portal"
   - "Harvard offers digital diplomas — visit Harvard's credential verification page"
4. **Online credentials matter**: Courses and certificates from top platforms (Coursera/MIT,
   edX/Harvard, NPTEL/IIT) carry real weight and should be included in the Education or
   Certifications section, not dismissed as informal learning
