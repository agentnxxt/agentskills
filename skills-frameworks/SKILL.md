name: skills-frameworks
description: >
  Shared vocabulary of professional skills frameworks used by Autonomyx skills. Contains the
  authoritative mapping of professions to their respective competency frameworks, skill codes,
  level definitions, and cross-framework equivalence tables. Use this skill whenever any
  Autonomyx skill needs to: map a skill to a professional framework, determine proficiency
  levels using a standardized competency model, select the correct framework for a given
  profession, or cross-reference skills across multiple frameworks. Covers IT (SFIA 9),
  cybersecurity (NICE/NIST), data science (EDISON), project management (PMI/IPMA), finance
  (CFA/ACCA), marketing (CIM), HR (SHRM/CIPD), design (UXPA), healthcare (AMIA), legal
  (SRA/ABA), supply chain (ASCM), engineering (UK-SPEC), education (UNESCO ICT), product
  management (Pragmatic), sales, and the European e-Competence Framework as a general fallback.

## Section 1 — Framework Selection Logic

When mapping a person's skills to a framework, follow this order:

1. **Identify the primary profession** from the person's most recent/current job title
2. **Match to the framework table** below
3. If the person spans multiple domains (e.g., a "Data Science Manager" spans EDISON + PMI),
   apply multiple frameworks
4. If no specific framework matches, use the **European e-Competence Framework (e-CF 4.0)**
   as a general fallback for any technology-adjacent role
5. For completely non-technical roles with no applicable framework, use the **Universal
   Proficiency Levels** (Section 12) without a framework code

| **Intermediate** | Solid working knowledge. Can deliver independently. 1–3 years of use. |
| **Advanced** | Strong proficiency. Can architect, mentor, and handle complex problems. 3–5 years. |
| **Expert** | Deep, authoritative command. Recognized by others in the field. 5+ years of sustained use. |

---

## Section 13 — When No Framework Exists

If the person's industry or profession is not covered by any framework listed above, follow
this protocol:

### Step 1 — Inform the user
Clearly state:
> "I could not find a recognized professional skills framework for **[industry/profession]**.
> The skills in this resume will be evaluated using general proficiency levels (Beginner /
> Intermediate / Advanced / Expert) unless you provide a specific framework."

### Step 2 — Ask the user
> "Do you have a preferred competency framework for **[industry/profession]**?
> This could be:
> - An industry body's competency model (e.g., a professional association's framework)
> - Your company's internal skills matrix or career ladder
> - A government or regulatory competency standard
> - Any other structured skills taxonomy
>
> If you provide a framework (as a URL, document, or description), I will map all skills
> to that framework instead."

### Step 3 — If the user provides a framework
1. Parse the user-provided framework (document, URL, or description)
2. Extract: skill categories, level definitions, competency codes (if any)
3. Map all resume skills to the user-provided framework
4. **Clearly state in the resume:** "Skills evaluated per: [Framework Name] ([source])"

### Step 4 — If the user does not provide a framework
1. Use the Universal Proficiency Levels (Section 12) for all skills
2. **Clearly state in the resume:** "Skills evaluated per: Universal Proficiency Levels
   (no industry-specific framework applied)"

### Mandatory disclosure
Every resume MUST include a **Framework Attribution** line in the Skills section header:

```
**Skills evaluated per:** [Framework Name] ([reference URL or "provided by user" or
"universal proficiency levels"])
```

This ensures transparency — any reader of the resume knows exactly which standard was used
to assess skill levels.
